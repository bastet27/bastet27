# Hello, I'm bastet27 ðŸ–¤

## ðŸ–¤ Introduction
I am a Cybersecurity student with an interest in pentesting and Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). Currently building skills and working on projects to track my growth in the field. 

## ðŸ–¤ Objective
To keep track of my projects and progress, with a focus on developing skills for potential roles in pentesting or DFIR.

## ðŸ–¤ Tools

### Endpoint
*Tools for endpoint security are currently being explored and will include solutions like antivirus, EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response), and file integrity monitoring systems.*

### Network
- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/): A powerful network scanning tool used for discovering hosts and services on a network.
- [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/): A search engine that allows you to find specific types of computers (webcams, routers, servers, etc.) connected to the internet.
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/): Used to analyze packets and detect anomalies.

### Pentesting Tools
- [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp): A web application security testing platform, currently being learned to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in web applications.
- [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/): A penetration testing framework, currently being explored for developing and executing exploit code.

### SIEM
- [Elastic SIEM](https://www.elastic.co/security/siem): A security analytics tool used to investigate alerts and differentiate between true and false positives during the TryHackMe Advent of Cyber challenges.
- [Wazuh](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/): A SIEM solution used to monitor logs and analyze alerts, deployed as part of the SOC Automation Lab for hands-on learning.

### Utilities
- [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/): A versatile data analysis and decoding tool used for tasks like decoding Base64-encoded PowerShell commands, parsing logs, and transforming data during investigations.

## ðŸ–¤ Certifications
*Currently, I have no certifications, but I am exploring training and certification options.*

## ðŸ–¤ Projects

- [SOC Automation Lab](https://github.com/bastet27/SOC-Lab1)  
  Developing a home lab to simulate a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment for hands-on learning. Key milestones include:  
  - **Installing Wazuh**: Deployed on an AWS EC2 instance using the AWS Free Tier to monitor logs and analyze alerts.  
  - Configured firewall rules and security groups for secure access to the Wazuh dashboard.  
  - Preparing to integrate tools like Shuffle (SOAR) and The Hive (Case Management) to enhance automation and incident response capabilities.

- [TryHackMe Advent of Cyber 2024](#)
  Participating in this month-long challenge to sharpen my SOC skills. Each challenge focuses on practical cybersecurity scenarios, including log analysis, investigating alerts, and differentiating between true and false positives.  
  - **Progress:** Logs and investigations analyzed for Day 1 and Day 2.  
  - **Write-Ups:** To avoid spoiling the event for others, detailed write-ups will be shared after the challenge ends.  

- [WiCyS SANS Security Scholarship](#)  
  Participating in the [WiCyS Security Training Scholarship](https://www.wicys.org/benefits/security-training-scholarship/), which includes:  
  - Progressing through TryHackMe's structured learning paths, such as Intro to Cybersecurity, Pre-Security, and Jr. Pen Tester.  
  - Solved Tier 2 CTF challenges involving web exploitation, cryptographic puzzles, packet analysis, and exploit development.  
  - Applied tools like Hydra for brute-forcing, CyberChef for decoding, Wireshark for analyzing packet captures, and Metasploit for exploiting vulnerabilities.
