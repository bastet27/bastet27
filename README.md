# Hello, I'm bastet27

## Introduction
Cybersecurity student with an interest in pentesting and Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). Currently building skills and working on projects to track my growth in the field.

## Objective
To keep track of my projects and progress, with a focus on developing skills for potential roles in pentesting or DFIR.

## Skills
- *Currently exploring and gaining hands-on experience in the following areas.*

| Skill                                | Description                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cryptographic Analysis               | Solved cipher, hashing, and decryption challenges. [WiCyS Tier 2 CTF](#)                      |
| Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) | Analyzed PCAPs and recovered corrupted files. [WiCyS Tier 2 CTF](#)                           |
| Exploit Development                  | Used Metasploit to exploit vulnerabilities. [WiCyS Tier 2 CTF](#)                            |
| Vulnerability Scanning               | Identified open ports and services using tools like Nmap and Gobuster. [WiCyS Tier 2 CTF](#) |
| Web Application Security             | Performed web exploitation tasks like brute-forcing and SQL injection during CTF challenges. [WiCyS Tier 2 CTF](#) |



## Tools
- *This section is for listing the tools I use, divided into categories such as Network, SIEM, and Endpoint.*

### Network
- Tools under "Network" include network analysis and monitoring software:
  - [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/): Used to analyze packets and detect anomalies.
  - [Nmap](https://nmap.org/): A powerful network scanning tool used for discovering hosts and services on a network.
  - [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/): A search engine that allows you to find specific types of computers (webcams, routers, servers, etc.) connected to the internet.

### Endpoint
- This section would list tools for endpoint security, such as antivirus or EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions, used to secure individual devices against threats.

### SIEM
- "SIEM" tools collect and analyze log data from across an environment. Examples include Splunk or Elastic, which help with threat detection and response.

### Pentesting Tools (Under Development)
- Tools under development for penetration testing include:
  - [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp): Currently learning this tool for web application security testing.
  - [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/): Currently learning this framework for developing, testing, and executing exploit code.

## Certifications
*Currently, I have no certifications, but I am exploring training and certification options.*

## Projects
- **WiCyS SANS Security Scholarship**  
  Participating in the [WiCyS Security Training Scholarship](https://www.wicys.org/benefits/security-training-scholarship/), which includes:  
  - Progressing through TryHackMe's structured learning paths, such as Intro to Cybersecurity, Pre-Security, and Jr. Pen Tester.  
  - Solved Tier 2 CTF challenges involving web exploitation, cryptographic puzzles, packet analysis, and exploit development.  
  - Applied tools like Hydra for brute-forcing, CyberChef for decoding, Wireshark for analyzing packet captures, and Metasploit for exploiting vulnerabilities.
  - *I will publish a write-up for this once the challenge is closed*
