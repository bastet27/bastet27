# Hello, I'm bastet27

## Introduction
Cybersecurity student with an interest in pentesting and Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). Currently building skills and working on projects to track my growth in the field.

## Objective
To keep track of my projects and progress, with a focus on developing skills for potential roles in pentesting or DFIR.

## Skills
- *Currently exploring and gaining hands-on experience in the following areas.*

| Skill                                         | Associated Project         |

## Tools
- *This section is for listing the tools I use, divided into categories such as Network, SIEM, and Endpoint.*

### Network
- Tools under "Network" include network analysis and monitoring software:
  - [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/): Used to analyze packets and detect anomalies.
  - [Nmap](https://nmap.org/): A powerful network scanning tool used for discovering hosts and services on a network.
  - [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/): A search engine that allows you to find specific types of computers (webcams, routers, servers, etc.) connected to the internet.

### Endpoint
- This section would list tools for endpoint security, such as antivirus or EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions, used to secure individual devices against threats.

### SIEM
- "SIEM" tools collect and analyze log data from across an environment. Examples include Splunk or Elastic, which help with threat detection and response.

### Pentesting Tools (Under Development)
- Tools under development for penetration testing include:
  - [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp): Currently learning this tool for web application security testing.
  - [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/): Currently learning this framework for developing, testing, and executing exploit code.

## Certifications
*Currently, I have no certifications, but I am exploring training and certification options.*

## Projects
- **WiCyS SANS Security Scholarship** â€“ Currently participating in the scholarship program to gain practical experience and training.
