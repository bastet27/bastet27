# Hello, I'm bastet27 ðŸ–¤

## ðŸ–¤ Introduction
Cybersecurity student with an interest in pentesting and Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). Currently building skills and working on projects to track my growth in the field.

## ðŸ–¤ Objective
To keep track of my projects and progress, with a focus on developing skills for potential roles in pentesting or DFIR.

## ðŸ–¤ Tools

### Network
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/): Used to analyze packets and detect anomalies.
- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/): A powerful network scanning tool used for discovering hosts and services on a network.
- [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/): A search engine that allows you to find specific types of computers (webcams, routers, servers, etc.) connected to the internet.

### Endpoint
- This section would list tools for endpoint security, such as antivirus or EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions, used to secure individual devices against threats.

### SIEM
- [Wazuh](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/): Deployed as part of the SOC Automation Lab to collect and analyze logs for threat detection and response.
- SIEM tools like Splunk and Elastic are also under exploration for their capabilities in log aggregation and security analytics.

### Pentesting Tools
- [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp): Currently learning this tool for web application security testing.
- [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/): Currently learning this framework for developing, testing, and executing exploit code.

## ðŸ–¤ Certifications
*Currently, I have no certifications, but I am exploring training and certification options.*

## ðŸ–¤ Projects

- [SOC Automation Lab](https://github.com/bastet27/SOC-Lab1)
  Developing a home lab to simulate a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment for hands-on learning. Key milestones include:  
  - **Installing Wazuh**: Deployed on an AWS EC2 instance using the AWS Free Tier to monitor logs and analyze alerts.  
  - Configured firewall rules and security groups for secure access to the Wazuh dashboard.  
  - Preparing to integrate tools like Shuffle (SOAR) and The Hive (Case Management) to enhance automation and incident response capabilities.

- [WiCyS SANS Security Scholarship](#)  
  Participating in the [WiCyS Security Training Scholarship](https://www.wicys.org/benefits/security-training-scholarship/), which includes:  
  - Progressing through TryHackMe's structured learning paths, such as Intro to Cybersecurity, Pre-Security, and Jr. Pen Tester.  
  - Solved Tier 2 CTF challenges involving web exploitation, cryptographic puzzles, packet analysis, and exploit development.  
  - Applied tools like Hydra for brute-forcing, CyberChef for decoding, Wireshark for analyzing packet captures, and Metasploit for exploiting vulnerabilities.
